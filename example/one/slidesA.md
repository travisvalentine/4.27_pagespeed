# Larry Page on Speed #
* ...speed is one of [Larry] Page's primary obsessions. "He's always measuring everything," early Googler Megan Smith says. She was once walking with Page down a street in Morocco when he suddenly dragged her into an internet caf√©. Immediately, he began timing how long it took web pages to load into a browser.

* ..."When people do demos and they're slow, I'm known to count sometimes," Page says. "One one-thousand, two one thousand. That tends to get people's attention." Paul Buchheit, the creator of Gmail, remembers performing an early demo of that service in Page's office. Page made a face and told him that it was way too slow. Buchheit objected, but Page reiterated his complaint, charging that it was taking at least 600 milliseconds to reload. Buchheit thought, "You can't know that." But when he got back to his office he checked the server logs. Six hundred milliseconds. "He nailed it..."- [Wired](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/05/features/the-second-coming-of-larry-page)
